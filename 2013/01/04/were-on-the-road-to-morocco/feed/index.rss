					<description><![CDATA[Will- you are my hero (as well as Latoya&#039;s!!) What a big heart you have to go all the way back and find her. I&#039;m a bit pissed that the school made no effort though; that could have turned into a very dangerous situation for her. I hope things change once you two start teaching. Casablanca... wow.. sounds like a dream. Your adventure is only beginning-I can&#039;t wait to read more! Stay safe, take it all in.   -Alix]]></description>
