					<description><![CDATA[Indonesia sounds pretty great and terrifying at the same time. I&#039;m loving your postings. Keep em coming. We just had our interviews a couple days ago for our Taiwan jobs. Should know in a week or so. Then we&#039;d be over in your part of the world in a little over three months! Thanks again for all the awesome advice. Good luck with everything!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, wonderful blog site.  Remember the story about the lighthouse keeper?  The foghorn didn&#039;t go off one time, and he jumped out of bed yelling &quot;what was that?&quot; You may just fall into the rhythm of the Imam.  This is a great way to get news.  You are having an adventure for all of us...... Terima koshi.
love,

					<description><![CDATA[No, no, no.  I did know her name, she is Parmi, I had just neglected to tell her mine.  She was following me around quizing me on it.  Now we communicate with a lot of hand gestures, the other night my room mates Indonesian Girlfriend told me Parmi told her I could speak Indonesian.  So now that we are straight on the names we communicate just fine.  But you are right, I am a lazy pampered round eye, no doubt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Louder?  Good news is I actually get a week off for Ramadan.  I will be in Indonesia but running around doing my thing.  So far it seems like people in Indonesia drink beer.  There was this yellow shit in Sumatra that came fermented out of the tops of palm trees called Tuack but I don&#039;t see any here.  I still don&#039;t know the local ghetto drink.  But if such an animal exists have no doubt or fear I will make an ass out of myself while drinking it.  Of that we must all be certain.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It tends to get louder during Ramadan, if my experience is to be any guide here.  So you got that look forward to.  Unless yr texting plan takes off.  You still on sham status?  Working your maid to the bone, one assumes, while drinking, wait, what does one drink in Indonesia anyhow?]]></description>
