					<description><![CDATA[Amazing and please, do not proof your blog as it&#039;s part of the enjoyment.  If it were perfectly written we&#039;d have to come up with another name, such as journal or some such blarney.  By the way, I am jealous of your museum visit!  Just went to the Terracotta Warriors thing here, which was good but not overwhelming as I&#039;m a History Channel junkie.  Bought way too many cheap souvenirs but I always do.  

I can&#039;t wait to hear more about the trip.  Please have a beer for me someplace beautiful, warm and serene - send pictures!!!  

Big hugs, warm wishes and happy thoughts..

					<description><![CDATA[Nope, you are the first!  It is kind of cool to be in Singapore for the third time.  The last two times where within a month of each other but it still counts.  It is sort of cool to look at a map of Singapore and have it make sense.  I loved your pictures of Bonair, by the way.  
It is good as always to have you with me on the blog, Amy Burke.
Give Ryan my love

					<description><![CDATA[HaHA! first note! =)

So I was wondering if it feels really cool to be in a country like Singapore and have it be familiar since you&#039;ve been there before.  It&#039;s so cool that you&#039;ve been there before!

I am sending big waves of good vibes your way as you head to Indonesia, your new home!!]]></description>
