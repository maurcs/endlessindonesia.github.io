					<description><![CDATA[jeez, I fly all the way to Indonesia, get the skinny from your friends about where you&#039;re going to be staying, wait for you to pass out, then hold your arms down and scream in your face, only to have to high-tail it back out of there and get back to US in time for work, and you think it&#039;s just some bad dream brought on by some creepy hotel. Man, did that prank ever fail.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you know, I think I may have Andrew Zimmern on weird food, or at least we are contemporaries.  I think he would beat me hands down in a Frank Black look-alike contest though, but yeah, I have had bovine proboscis and I got that going for me, which is nice.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry it took me so long (two whole days!) to read this one Will...in my defense, I must have checked in right before you posted this, and I have been back at work this week for &quot;boot camp.&quot;  I&#039;m all caught up now though!

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even seen Andrew Zimmern eating cow&#039;s nose, so kudos on that one.  The haunted hotel sounds creepy, but not so bad with a group of people.  What I really want to know is...did you get to a doctor? I guess it&#039;s the maternal instinct in me, but a sore throat that bad needs to be checked out! =)]]></description>
