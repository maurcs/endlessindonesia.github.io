					<description><![CDATA[Mucho excitement here in our little house that our mug has had a role in your latest adventure!  =)  I&#039;m so, so very happy that everything is going so well for you...what a change from those first days in China.  China turned out to be so awesome for you that I just can&#039;t imagine how amazingly things will continue to be for you in Indonesia!  I&#039;m so impressed that you are going to the gym and riding your bike everywhere...I could use a little of that juice over here!  

We miss you Will Scandals, but I don&#039;t wish you were here because I know how damn happy you are over there.  When you find yourself with that level of contentment and satisfaction with life, you definitely need to keep doing whatever it is that you&#039;re doing!

I love you Will!  I promise to try to write a real email soon.  =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[back at you
there certainly are times I wish I was there too, brother.  If for no better reason than you always have that good whiskey.  Are you still watching the Sopranos?  Have they introduced Ralph Viferelli yet?  
And you are right, the people do make or break a place for me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You just tell me how the workout is going and I&#039;ll adjust your image in the header accordingly.

I&#039;m enjoying the developing relationship between you and the woman that maintains your house (what&#039;s her name again?). Beyond all your travels, I find it the most interesting that you choose to write about the people you form relationships with. This leads me to believe that to Will Sanders, traveling is not about the destination but about the people that call that destination home.

Further, an adventure is most likely to happen when anyone, regardless of their location, chooses to put themselves outside of their boundaries and into a place where they are more vulnerable to new relationships.

Whoa, where&#039;d that come from? Must be the Bourbon talking. Why aren&#039;t you on my couch watching the Sopranoes? I love you Sanders.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh that makes sense!  So many brand new things to worry about, now I need to find someone to rub coins on my skin, just to be on the safe side.  I look forward to seeing you when you come, still trying to track down that sweet yellow palm tree juice, but worst case we just get drunk on something else.  see you when you get here!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just glad someone I know is  living life to the fullest. So many people get tied up and it holds them back. I wish I had your drive. I know I&#039;m tenacious, but I don&#039;t have the luck. I knew I should&#039;ve up and moved years ago, or follow your lead. But alas, I&#039;m still in Shitlanta reading your great adventures. If people don&#039;t like that you&#039;re living life and have a problem with it, screw them. It&#039;s your life, enjoy it, and you seem to be doing a fine job at it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Entertaining read as ever...especially the maid story &quot;Although regardless the state of things in my room she is very fastidious about always going in everyday after I have left to turn off my fan, insuring that I come home to a stuffy sweltering hot box each night.&quot; - with a dirty mind, it&#039;s hilarious! 
So ur off to kawah ijen? the sulphur place - menarik..interesting....
Anyway bro, see u in a couple o weeks...get searching out tuak man!!!
ps people wear jackets on motorbikes coz they dont wanna get ill from masuk angin... a somewhat bizzare belief that wind enters their body n causes all kinds of problems which needs to be removed by scratching metal coins on the skin....
