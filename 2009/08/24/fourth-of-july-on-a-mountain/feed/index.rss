					<description><![CDATA[When I was a little girl, my Grandaddy Bugg would tell us bedtime stories (usually after a hearty dinner of sauteed chicken bites, otherwise known as &quot;Chicken McBuggets&quot;).  One of our favorites was about the time he was camping in the jungle and some mischievous little monkeys stole all of his things.  Not a word of it was true, but I always loved picturing that little gang of monkeys up in the trees, wearing his watch and shiny belt buckle.  Color me jealous Will Sanders. =)]]></description>
