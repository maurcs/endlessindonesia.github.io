					<description><![CDATA[Is the name &quot;Dolly&#039;s&quot; some misbegotten Dolly Parton ref?  I don&#039;t know, sounds depressing and sad.  Never trust a whoremonger.  That&#039;s my advice.  Oh, and yes, of course, I always wanted to know what the Indonesian for lantern slide is.  What&#039;s a lantern slide?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hope Jane comes to stay and you fall-for-really-real-in-love and make babies. Not right away, but someday.  All babies are cute, but chubby Asian babies are the cutest. =)  

It is hard to believe that there are people in the world who feel comfortable exploiting another person and using them in a way that disregards their humanity.  Even sadder that there are people who have to be used in order to survive. 

I enjoyed the pictures in the sulphur camp...can&#039;t wait to hear the story!  Love you and miss you Will!]]></description>
