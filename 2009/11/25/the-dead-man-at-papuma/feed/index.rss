					<description><![CDATA[I remember you telling me that story about the God-send Eagle, flying in on cue. That was one of our last conversations before you left again for Indonesia. I miss you Will Sanders.

As I was in the middle of that, reading about you dancing on a cliff in a remote part of the world alone, I just thought it would be so great to transport some of us there. In the dark, dancing. Just for 15 minutes. To say we&#039;d done it. We&#039;re here. No small talk, just being there together. Wouldn&#039;t that be fun?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Those pictures are incredible Will!  Although I am sort of enjoying the cloudy, gray days we are having here right now (it is November, after all), I am also feeling incredibly jealous imagining you sitting on that beautiful beach!  I&#039;m always so amazed at how easily you make friends and find adventures everywhere you go.  

Now I want to hear more about what you are doing in Jember, and most of all, more about this girl who is kissing you like a sleeping princess. =)]]></description>
