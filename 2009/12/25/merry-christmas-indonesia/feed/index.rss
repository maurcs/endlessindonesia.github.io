					<description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas Will!

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re back in Surabya... at least maybe you&#039;ll connect more.

I&#039;m in Tampa with the In-Laws. I&#039;ve been watching some Chris Marker. Also we all watched White Christmas. With my father in law I always watch westerns from Movies Worth Seeing. This visit we watched Left-Handed Gun, True Grit (preparing for the Coen Brothers remake), and The Cowboys. Besides not being able to see my family in Colorado, it&#039;s been a good Christmas by all accounts. 

P.S. I love your Christmases as a young little Will-er-snapper.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you wrote this Will...as we were getting out of the car tonight coming home from my Grandmother&#039;s house, Ryan suddenly said, &quot;It&#039;s already Christmas in Indonesia!&quot;  So we were thinking of you, and it&#039;s nice to be able to picture how you are spending your holidays.  We are watching &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (&quot;Scrooged&quot; was last night), and waiting for Santa to show up.  Joseph is thumping away in my belly right now, so I think that means he wants to wish you a Merry Christmas too, and tell you that he can&#039;t wait to meet you this summer.  So, Merry Christmas Will, from the whole Burke family!!  We love you and miss you!]]></description>
