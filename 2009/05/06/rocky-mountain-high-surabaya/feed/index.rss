					<description><![CDATA[I love that the time stamps are Indonesia time...then I can keep up with what time it is there!

Fun and adventure as always Will Sanders.  How many classes do you teach each week and what age groups are they?  

Can&#039;t wait to hear about your weekend trip, wherever you may end up.

I think you should get a motorcycle. =)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice work with the pictures Will, I knew you could do it.

I&#039;m glad your maid lectured you.

Does the little face have a name?

Also, looks like those kids had you fooled. Table is a verb. 

I&#039;m having a fun time imagining you drunk trying to break into your house, in a foreign country, and I&#039;m curious about the thoughts of the people there, that for the first time are encountering Will Sanders.

Take lots of pictures of the mountains or beach, hopefully I will have the photos page up soon so you can upload pictures without necessarily inserting them into a blog.

Rock on!]]></description>
