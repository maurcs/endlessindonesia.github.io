					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I really liked talking to you guys too.  I miss you guys a whole bunch but not as bad as China because I still get to hang out with nice people a lot here.  But talking to you guys the other night made me pine for late nights over beers at your house, conversations about Stan Lee at 4 AM, and all that.  Thanks for being blog believer #1]]></description>
