					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the heads up Will Sanders!  Glad to know you are off to more adventures (and I mean next year, because even though it won&#039;t be like Indo or China, grad school will be a sort of adventure!).  Things keep rolling along, don&#039;t they?

Did you know that we probably live less than a mile from This is it!, and we have never been?  Do we really need to check it out? The billboards and commercials always seemed sort of hokey to me. =)

Vermont is closer than Indonesia, but it is still kind of far.  Will you be in Atlanta for a visit before you head that way?  Joseph is almost two and I&#039;m pretty sure he doesn&#039;t remember you from your visit in the hospital...]]></description>
