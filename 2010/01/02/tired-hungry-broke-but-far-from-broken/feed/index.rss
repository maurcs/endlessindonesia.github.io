					<description><![CDATA[furthermore, you have some of my Miles Davis records if you dig them out.  I can recommend one that I want to say was called ESP, not sure.  It was a white sleeve with a photo on the front with him looking at a pretty girl in awe.  That one is worth a spin, and I think I had one with him at newport on side A and Thaloneous Monk at newport on side B.  I am sure you know the birth of cool, bitches brew, kind of blue, all the biggies.  There were so many different sounds from different times from Miles Davis, and you almost can&#039;t go wrong.  I say that but I do have one of his from the early 80s in there with way too much synth for my jazz taste.  I like to think of that as his &#039;we are the world&#039; period.  Other than that, he was almost always great.  I can&#039;t remember what other miles I had in there, but I am sure you dug through it all by now anyways.

					<description><![CDATA[A coolie is the name for someone who&#039;s job it is to fetch things for people, usually in a jungle situation.  I do have a cell phone, I can send you the number if you like.  I thank you for your kind words about my travel ethic.  It really is fun to have crazy adventures and not know where or how you will end up, for some reason I guess I am wired that way.  
I have only just now gotten two bits of spam but this time they are more amusing, on for jesus and one for carpet cleaning.  I haven&#039;t walked on a carpet in months!!!!
take care.  I will try to call you soon but skype is all on the fritz]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s a coolie? You have a cell phone? 

Good call on the Miles Davis. Perhaps that will be a good listen this afternoon. 

I was commenting to someone the other day, I think it was Mary Beth, about how you&#039;re attitude is so perfect for traveling. God laughs at those who plan or something like that. Anyway, not that I enjoy your struggle, but I do enjoy reading about you facing these challenges. You take them head on, own up to your mistakes and deal. It&#039;s admirable, really.

If what doesn&#039;t kill you makes you stronger, then Indonesia is like your Gold&#039;s Gym. Or maybe Muscle Beach. Nevermind, skip it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad things finally worked out for you Will, and that you were able to get some food and a place to say.  Sounds like the day from hell.  Also glad to hear that the next part of the story will be happier!

Today is New Year&#039;s Day.  Last night, we went to Monty&#039;s girlfriends for a New Year&#039;s party...it was fun, but we were definitely thinking of you, and thinking how you were already enjoying the new year somewhere in Indonesia.  I am so very excited about the wonderful things that 2010 will hold for me and Ryan, and I hope that you are out there feeling excited and hopeful too!  Love you and miss you!]]></description>
