					<description><![CDATA[Mr. Sanders. I do not like big spiders. Spiders scare me. And big spiders scare me also. I do not like when you go into cave with spiders. Many spiders crawl on your back and your front. If spiders like flesh, you are in big trouble. Please stay away from cave with spiders. Stick to cave with skulls. You crazy mister!

Also, I think you should get a cowbell and hang out near the albino buffalo. When you notice the crowd has changed and about 75% of the surrounding people are new, you should walk up and do your routine. Then walk around and have everyone put money in your cowbell. Go buy booze. Repeat until intoxicated.

I seriously wish you had a picture of the spiders. I can&#039;t believe there eyes glow. That gives me the willies!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my favorite kind of stuff to read Will...keep it coming!

(Also, I have not checked my facebook, but it did send me your comment to email, and yes, I am getting a little fat, but not overly. =)  I expect that before this is all over I will have a giant balloon of a belly, and I will be sure to send you a picture of the ridiculousness).]]></description>
