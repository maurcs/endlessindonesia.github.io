					<description><![CDATA[Will, firstly, I would like to extend my sincerest sympathies for your loss.

Your recount of your last few hours with Luke was not only saddening but it gave a great insight into Luke’s life, character and his relationship with Tabi.

Although I never met Luke, I had heard many great things from his dad. The respect and love his dad extended to Luke and Tabi was testament to two special individuals.

I take comfort in reading your story knowing that Luke seemed to have the time of his life. I thank you for sharing that sentiment.

In thought

					<description><![CDATA[What an incredibly sad loss! I remember some of your stories about Luke, and I know how you gauge people. He must have been an incredible person. This feels so silly, leaving a comment for something like this. Rest in peace Luke. You&#039;re in my thoughts Will.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Will, found out about it this morning myself and am stunned. I don&#039;t normally write anything in public, it&#039;s not my way but there is always a first time and I needed to let your readers know that you are so right about Luke. He was one of those guys that was always happy and nothing much seemed to upset him. Even though on this occasion he got drunk, very drunk by the sound of it, he was not in my opinion reckless or stupid, he was a just young guy having fun and living life. He and Tabi came to one of my parties and we spent hours laughing and chatting, he always seemed in control and they were so in to each other. I can&#039;t really understand what happened and I don&#039;t know if we will ever really find out exactly what happened. I am still trying to accept it as one of those really shit things that life throws at you sometimes. It is still raw at the moment and we are all in shock. My heart goes out to his family and to Tabi who must be going through hell. She has the support of some very good people at EF, we will all rally round for her. I want to remember Luke as the person he was, a very warm, friendly, fun guy. I too am already missing him.]]></description>
