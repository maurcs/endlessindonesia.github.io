					<description><![CDATA[So glad you finally found some time to post some more of your stories Will...you know how much I look forward to reading them!  I like how they almost always end up with you drinking beers with a new foreign friend someplace cool. =)  Also, I&#039;m glad you are not a water buffalo or an eagle, but our own dear Will Sanders who we are excited to see again very soon!  Love you and miss you!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Forest Moon, of Endor&quot; or &quot;Forest Moon of Endor&quot;.

That spider gives me the willies. (and I&#039;m not talking about the kind where some dude comes over to your house to play records, the wire, eats your brataco&#039;s and sleeps on your couch.)

Great post Will, I wish you would have taken a picture with your &quot;biker buddy&quot;. Also, isn&#039;t it interesting that an eagle showed up during this time? Like the other time you told my about an eagle popping up into your field of view?]]></description>
