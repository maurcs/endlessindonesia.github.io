					<description><![CDATA[Lord yes.  That is ever so true.  
I miss you already, but I am sure where ever you wind up landing will be better when you get there.  I can tell because things just aren&#039;t the same around here since you left us.  Happy trails and good luck with your list.  I hope you cross a lot of them off but never all of them, we always need to have a few left to aim for or else no more fun.  Holler at Annie in aus for me.
love

					<description><![CDATA[Actually it was top 47. Not 43.  Not 51.  but the number is not important.  what is important is to think about what&#039;s important to you and write it down.  look it over every now and again, share it with friends - who will then pretend it was their fabulous idea (I forget who I stole this idea from, my friend jenny I think).

I always feel that I&#039;m making the most of my life when I see that I&#039;m working towards or actually done something on my list.  Think big, dream crazy dreams and above all have a fucking kick ass time!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Willy!
I absolutely love this list and you can&#039;t count, you have 51 things and not 50! If we were holding our breaths under water I would be much better and beat you but I&#039;m not very good on land! I&#039;m sitting at school reading your list and giggling like an idiot cos I think everythign you have on your list is amazing and I hope you&#039;re achieving! I do feel a bit guilty though as it was Brenda who told me to write a top 43 and then I just passed that on to you! But I love your list. I need to get cracking on mine. When I do, I&#039;ll send it to you asap. I&#039;d like more info about the logistics of number 51 please.... Talk to you soon Willy and see you soon in Indo town!!]]></description>
